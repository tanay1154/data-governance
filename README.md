# data-governance
Our data governance project aims to visualize and provide insights from a businessâ€™ data by streaming the data from the enterprise. This streamed data will go through an ETL process and will be stored in a cloud/database to later derive insights from. These insights may be used by the enterprise to increase their efficiency and maximize their profits.
